<h3>1. Create repository and write your code</h3>
<p>
  The first step is the most obvious one - if you want to create some piece of
  software to be used by others, well, create it first. Somewhere in this
  process it's worth to set up public repository for your code - after all, this
  is going to be open source software, so you want others to be able to read the
  source code. I would also advise to not wait with creating repository until
  your source code is done, rather put it there continuously and incrementally -
  you never know when your computer is going to explode, and with it all the
  data. You can set up public repository for free using
  <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, among others.
</p>
<p>
  In your repository, besides your source code, it's crucial to also include
  unit tests (bonus points for additional layers of testing). Without those, how
  could others trust that your package actually works and does the things it is
  supposed to do? And about those things - what exactly is your software doing?
  You'll need to create comprehensive description and documentation, preferably
  with examples of usage, so that people can assess if your package meets their
  needs and understand how to use it.
</p>
<p>
  In my case, I've created
  <a
    href="https://github.com/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator"
    target="_blank"
    >GitHub repository</a
  >
  for my package, in which I've placed
  <a
    href="https://github.com/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator/blob/master/README.md"
    target="_blank"
    >readme file</a
  >
  with documentation and user manual. It's a trivial tool, so I thought that
  unit tests would be enough. I wrote them with the help of
  <a href="https://jest.io/" target="_blank">Jest</a>, placed them in
  <a
    href="https://github.com/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator/tree/master/src/tests"
    target="_blank"
    >separate directory</a
  >, and created simple
  <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts" target="_blank">NPM scripts</a>
  which runs them:
</p>
<partial name="code" language="json">
  <pre>
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --config ./jestconfig.json"
  }
}</pre
  >
</partial>
<h3>2. Set up continuous integration</h3>
<p>
  Now that you have your software created and tested, it would be a pity if you
  forgot to run your tests before publishing this or any subsequent version of
  the package. It's a risk - without testing your software against your test
  cases, despite your best efforts, you won't know for sure if it still works
  (of course with tests you also won't know it for sure, but this issue is
  rather related to tests coverage and quality, which makes up for entirely
  different topic). Even if you'll remember about this step today, there is
  always a risk you'll forget to perform it at some point in future. Therefore,
  it's a good idea to create an automated process which will perform this step
  for you. Additionally, your users can benefit from such setup - they will know
  that your code is tested automatically, they will be able to check if it
  passes those tests, they won't have to trust your word on it.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of tools to set up continuous integration, for example
  <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank">Circle CI</a>,
  <a href="https://www.codeship.io/" target="_blank">CodeShip</a>, or
  <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>. I decided to
  use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>, as it is
  very well matured solution with plenty of possibilities for integrations with
  other systems.
</p>
<p>
  In order to use it, I had to sign up with my GitHub account and enable
  integrations for selected repository. Then, I created
  <code>.travis.yml</code> file in my project, which encapsulated basic
  configuration of my setup. Due to the fact that my test command is literally
  named <code>test</code>, I only had to inform Travis about programming in
  which my package is written.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="yaml">
  <pre>
language: node_js
node_js:  
  - 10
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  From the moment I pushed this file to my GitHub repository, for this and every
  subsequent push, Travis is running my tests for me. Result of this process is
  also
  <a
    href="https://travis-ci.org/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator"
    target="_blank"
    >publicly available</a
  >.
</p>
<h3>3. Set up code coverage calculation</h3>
<p>
  Your code is being tested in continuous and automated manner and this
  information is accessible to your users. That's good, but still one can ask,
  how good your tests are? Can they be trusted? There are different ways to
  assess quality of your tests, one of them being coverage - metric describing
  how much of your code is actually invoked during this whole testing process.
  Majority of tests runners have a feature for calculating your tests code
  coverage, and my weapon of choice - Jest - is no different. I only had to add
  <code>--coverage</code> flag to my script running tests in order for it to
  determine this value for me.
</p>
<p>
  This simple computation is not enough, though. I wanted this information to be
  calculated automatically and transparent to my users. Again, there are
  different tools that can do this for you, such as
  <a href="https://codecov.io/" target="_blank">CodeCov</a> or
  <a href="https://coveralls.io/" target="_blank">Coveralls</a>. I decided to
  use the latter, as it can be integrated with Travis CI in an extremely simple
  way.
</p>
<p>
  And again, I had to start with signing up with my GitHub account, and enabling
  integration for selected repository. Then, I installed
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/coveralls" target="_blank"
    >coveralls package from NPM</a
  >
  and created additional, separate NPM script to calculate code coverage and
  push it to its destination:
</p>
<partial name="code" language="json">
  <pre>
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --config ./jestconfig.json",
    "test:coverage": "npm run test -- --coverage | coveralls"
  }
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Coveralls requires code coverage report to be provided in specific format
  named LCOV. Jest has no issues with that - all I had to do was to enable it in
  my <code>jestconfig.json</code> file:
</p>
<partial name="code" language="json">
  <pre>
{
  "coverageReporters": [
    "text-lcov"
  ]
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Then, I triggered my new script from Travis, utilizing capabilities of
  <code>.travis.yml</code> file:
</p>
<partial name="code" language="yaml">
  <pre>
language: node_js
node_js:  
  - 10
after_success: npm run test:coverage
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Once those changes were pushed to my GitHub repoository and Travis finished
  testing my package, code coverage calculation was performed, report was
  generated, and result was passed to Coveralls, where my code coverage level
  became
  <a
    href="https://coveralls.io/github/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator"
    target="_blank"
    >publicly available information</a
  >.
</p>
<h3>4. Set up automated check for security vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>
  Another automated process that is worth setting up is check for security
  vulnerabilities. Open source projects tend to rely on other open source
  projects and use them as dependencies. You can do this too, and you can do it
  for free - and so can others with your project (unless you specifically
  disallow it in your license file). This amazing feature of open source world
  comes with a risk: you don't know authors of other packages and you don't know
  their intentions. Most of the time they are as pure as yours, but there are
  rare exceptions. Using given package as your dependency, you might
  unintentionally spread some malicious software to your users. It's worth to
  put some extra effort to protect them from this.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, I decided to integrate my project with
  <a href="https://snyk.io/" target="_blank">snyk</a>, an open source security
  platform. It didn't require me to modify anything in my code, all I had to do
  was to again sign up with my GitHub account and enable integration for
  particular repository. Guys at snyk maintain and regularly update list of
  malicious, open source packages. Now that my project is scanned by them on a
  daily basis, they'll let me know if they find anything suspicious in it, be it
  today or in one year from now. More importantly, this information is also
  <a
    href="https://snyk.io/test/github/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator"
    target="_blank"
    >publicly available</a
  >, so that my users know that there are no security vulnerabilities in my
  project as of now, and will be informed if there will be any security
  vulnerabilities found in future.
</p>
<h3>5. Set up automated releases</h3>
<p>
  This step probably could be done somewhere at the beginning of this list,
  preferably around the time when first commit was made, so that whole history
  is present in automatically generated changelog - but sometimes it's better to
  not have whole history in changelog, especially these early commits.
  Nevertheless, in this step I propose to use specific tool, such as
  <a
    href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version"
    target="_blank"
    >standard-version</a
  >
  or
  <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release" target="_blank"
    >semantic-release</a
  >, which can assist you with releases of your package - automatically bump
  version number, appropriately tag certain commits on GitHub, and generate
  changelog file.
</p>
<p>
  For my project I used standard-version. Configuration is trivial - I installed
  the package and created dedicated script in my NPM scripts:
</p>
<partial name="code" language="json">
  <pre>
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version"
  }
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  This tool, in order to work properly, requires following specific convention
  in your commit messages, so that it knows what to put in your changelog file
  and which part of your version number to bump. I followed the convention and
  ended up with automatically generated
  <a
    href="https://github.com/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator/releases"
    target="_blank"
    >list of releases</a
  >
  in my GitHub repository as well as automatically generated
  <a
    href="https://github.com/soofka/webpack-bundle-content-validator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"
    target="_blank"
    >changelog file</a
  >. Those can come handy not only to users of my package but also to potential,
  future maintainers.
</p>
<h3>6. Publish your package to NPM</h3>
<p>
  Now that all of this work is done, you can publish your nice, well-documented,
  well-tested, secure - basically reliable and legitimate - package to NPM
  repository of packages. All steps above were described with an assumption that
  you know how it works and have your project configured properly for NPM, but
  it's always worth to read
  <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish" target="_blank"
    >how publishing works and how to set it up</a
  >. My only advice in that regard is to create separate NPM script which will
  build and test your project before it goes to NPM. Just in case.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="json">
  <pre>
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run build && npm run test"
  }
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Congratulations! Now you can sit back, relax and use
  <a href="https://npm-stat.com/" target="_blank">npm-stat</a> to monitor how
  your project is being used in other projects all over the world.
</p>
