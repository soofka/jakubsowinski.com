<p>
  So far, for a few years already, whenever I wanted my application to have some
  global state, I've used <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a>. It's reliable, it works, and it's quite easy to
  implement, although, admittedly, it's not that easy to learn. In order to get
  a grasp of it, one has to understand non-trivial implementation of flow of
  data through store, actions, and reducers. It easily can get really confusing
  at the beginning.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing I've noticed about Redux is that it's often used wrongly. It's
  easy to use it in a wrong way - more often than not it still works - but using
  it properly, by the book, requires at least shallow understanding of
  underlying theoretical concepts. More importantly, applying them to one's code
  sometimes can be tricky, might require some refactoring, and usually ends up
  somewhere around the end of technical debt list.
</p>
<p>
  Lately, huge rise in popularity of another state management library, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/" target="_blank">MobX</a>, can
  be observed. I see it being adapted in more and more projects and getting more
  and more community support. Therefore, I wanted to try it out myself. My first
  impression of it was that it must be simpler, more straight forward version of
  Redux - it's described by its authors as "simple, scalable state management
  library" for a reason. Given the nature of my project - this blog, which is
  really far from being complex application - I figured, that the simplest
  solution will be the best (and that it's also great opportunity to taste it).
</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>
  First thing I've done in order take my first steps with MobX was taking a few
  looks at it's very well written <a href="https://mobx.js.org/" target="_blank">documentation</a>. It covers not only technical
  details of every piece of library, which I mostly left for later. More
  importantly for me at the beginning, there is description of theoretical
  foundation of the package, which I recommend to check out to everyone who
  starts their adventure with it.
</p>
<p>
  Once I got familiar with <a href="https://mobx.js.org/intro/concepts.html" target="_blank">concepts and principles</a>, I was ready to add the
  library to my project. Along MobX itself, I installed also <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react" target="_blank">MobX-React</a> package,
  which redefines some of MobX features as React component wrappers, so that one
  can implement it in their React application conveniently.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="bash">
  <pre>
npm install --save mobx mobx-react
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Knowing that I'm using React Router library to handle routing in my
  application, and having experience from Redux, where I had to use additional
  library to make these two get along well and without issues, I immediately
  searched for some equivalent for MobX, and found <a href="https://github.com/alisd23/mobx-react-router" target="_blank">MobX-React-Router</a>.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="bash">
  <pre>
npm install --save mobx-react-router
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Following basic example in the documentation, I quickly set up simple store
  with default routing, as provided by the library. I only had to modify main
  file of my project, where root component is.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'mobx-react';
import { Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { RouterStore, syncHistoryWithStore } from 'mobx-react-router';
import createBrowserHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory';

import Blog from 'components/Blog';

const routingStore = new RouterStore();

const browserHistory = createBrowserHistory();
const history = syncHistoryWithStore(browserHistory, store.routingStore);

const store = {
  routingStore,
};

const render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider {...store}>
      <Router history={history}>
        <Blog/>
      </Router>
    </Provider>,
    document.querySelector('app'),
  );
};

render();
</pre>
</partial>
<p>Now I was ready to implement my own MobX store.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<h4>Defining the store</h4>
<p>
  What I wanted to implement was very simple, conceptually. I wanted to have
  global app state with only one variable: language. Following MobX
  documentation and a few basic tutorials I've found over the Internet (most
  notably, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html" target="_blank">short introduction to MobX and React</a>, being part of MobX
  documentation, and this <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-your-first-app-with-mobx-and-react-aea54fbb3265" target="_blank">basic example by JS Craft</a>), I decided to go for simple
  class with one field. Of course I did it in TypeScript.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
export interface LanguageStoreInterface {
  language: string;
  getLanguage: () => string;
  setLanguage: (language: string) => void;
}

class LanguageStore implements LanguageStoreInterface {

  language = 'en';

  getLanguage = (): string => this.language;

  setLanguage = (language: string): void => this.language = language;

}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Now I had one source of truth about currently selected language in my
  application. How to make it accessible to all parts of my application and
  ensure they all use the same instance? In order to achieve that, I wrapped it
  in MobX decorator, defined <code>language</code> as an <code><a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/observable.html" target="_blank">observable</a></code>, and <code>setLanguage</code> as an
  <code><a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/action.html" target="_blank">action</a></code>. Therefore, language property became observed by MobX - any instance
  which observes it will be notified about its change - and <code>setLanguage</code> method
  became privileged to modify <code>language</code> in global context.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
import { action, decorate, observable } from 'mobx';

export interface LanguageStoreInterface {
  language: string;
  getLanguage: () => string;
  setLanguage: (language: string) => void;
}

class LanguageStore implements LanguageStoreInterface {

  language = 'en';

  getLanguage = (): string => this.language;

  setLanguage = (language: string): void => this.language = language;

}

decorate(LanguageStore, {
  language: observable,
  setLanguage: action,
});
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Last step was adding this small piece of code to my already existing store,
  created with the help of MobX-React-Router. Again, I had to modify main file
  of the application, where root component is.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
import { languageStore } from 'store/language';

// ...

const store = {
  routingStore,
  languageStore,
};
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  That's it - now I had simple MobX store in my application, ready to interact
  with.
</p>
<h4>Modifying the store</h4>
<p>
  In the next step, I created simple component with two buttons, which purpose
  was to switch between languages - <code>LanguageSwitcher</code>. Then, using <code>inject</code> method
  from MobX-React, I made it familiar with <code>LanguageStore</code>, and used <code>setLanguage</code>
  action to set proper value in global app state.
</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript"><pre>
import * as React from 'react';
import { inject } from 'mobx-react';

import { LanguageStoreInterface } from 'store/language';

import GreatBritainFlag from './flags/GreatBritainFlag';
import PolandFlag from './flags/PolandFlag';

interface LanguageSwitcherPropsInterface {
  languageStore?: LanguageStoreInterface;
}

export const LanguageSwitcher = (props: LanguageSwitcherPropsInterface): JSX.Element => {
  const { languageStore: { setLanguage } } = props;

  return (
    <ul className="language-switcher">
      <li>
        <GreatBritainFlag onClick={() => setLanguage('en')} />
      </li>
      <li>
        <PolandFlag onClick={() => setLanguage('pl')} />
      </li>
    </ul>
  );
};

export default inject('languageStore')(LanguageSwitcher);
</pre></partial>
<p>Note, that <code>languageStore</code> prop in my props interface had to be optional. Otherwise, TypeScript would complain about it not being provided by parent component. I'm yet to discover how to implement it in a way, that this prop is required, as it should be. If you know the trick, don't hesitate to let me know in comments.</p>
<p>Having my <code>LanguageSwitcher</code>, clicking on one of it's buttons altered global state and set proper language value in it. However, there was no visible change in my application - for that I had to implement components, that react to this change.</p>
<h4>Reacting to changes in store</h4>
<p>The most basic way of doing so in MobX, from what I've learned, was to implement <code><a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/observer-component.html" target="_blank">observer</a></code>. Wrapping React component with such decorator makes it aware of any changes in the state. Therefore, I created <code>Label</code> component, which observed the store and automatically reacted to <code>language</code> change, and I reimplemented all static pieces of text in my UI to use this component. Additionally, I had to inject <code>LanguageStore</code> to it, so that I could always get proper, current language value for my <code>Label</code> to render. Then I created simple JS objects with translations to both languages.</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript"><pre>
import * as React from 'react';
import { inject, observer } from 'mobx-react';

import { LanguageStoreInterface } from 'store/language';

import labels from 'labels';

interface LabelPropsInterface {
  name: string;
  languageStore?: LanguageStoreInterface;
}

export const Label = (props: LabelPropsInterface) => {
  const { name, languageStore: { getLanguage }, ...rest } = props;
  return <span {...rest}>{labels[getLanguage()][name]}</span>;
};

export default inject('languageStore')(observer(Label));
</pre></partial>
<p>One thing I learned in the process is that <code>observer</code> should always be the innermost (first applied) decorator; otherwise it might do nothing at all.</p>
<p>After this change, clicking on my <code>LanguageSwitcher</code> button, which was not corresponding to currently set language, resulted in immediate change in UI of my application - static pieces of text were taken from the other JS object with translations and rerendered properly. Cool thing that came out of the box was that clicking on the button that corresponds to already selected language didn't result in any component being rerendered, which is good for performance of my app.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my list of entries didn't react to this change at all. Obviously, I also wanted this component to change with <code>setLanguage</code> action - I only wanted entries translated to Polish to appear when in Polish version, and vice versa - and it turned out to be much trickier than I expected.</p>
<p>After a few hours of frustrating attempts to make my Entries component with an <code>observer</code>, which I used for <code>Label</code> component, I learned important lesson about MobX - <strong><code>observer</code> makes your component react to any observable you use in <code>render()</code></strong>. I used <code>language</code> parameter, which was observable, in this component, but only in <code>componentDidMount</code> function, where I fetched all the entries, not in render function. I had to come up with different idea.</p>
<p>Another few hours later, I've found what I needed in <code><a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/reaction.html" target="_blank">reaction</a></code> function from MobX. During this research I discovered that MobX offers a lot of ways to interact with the store in variety of manners. Among different methods, <code>reaction</code> was precisely what I needed for this case. Using it, one can define his custom way of, well, reacting to change in one of his observables. Unlike <code>observer</code>, which is tightly coupled with render function, reaction allowed me to refetch posts whenever <code>language</code> changed without referring to <code>LanguageStore</code> during render phase.</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript"><pre>
export class Entries extends React.Component<EntriesPropsInterface, EntriesStateInterface> {
  constructor(props: EntriesPropsInterface) {
    super(props);

    reaction(
      () => this.props.languageStore.language,
      () => {
        this.getEntries();
      },
    );
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    if (!this.state.entries) {
      this.getEntries();
    }
  }

  // ...
}

export default inject('languageStore')(Entries);
</pre></partial>
<p>After all, I enriched my application with simple store, made it compliant with other libraries in my stack, made some components that modify the store, and made some components that react to these modifications - in both trivial and non-that-trivial way. As always, all code that I wrote can be found on my GitHub, in <a href="https://github.com/soofka/blog" target="_blank">my blog repository</a>. Live example of it is this blog you're currently reading, although at the time of publishing this post, LanguageSwitcher component itself might not be visible to you yet. I implemented the feature, but I also have to actually translate some posts to Polish for it to make sense. As always, I started with the most fun part...</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
  So, what I learned in the process? One thing I learned, at least a little bit,
  is, of course, MobX itself. Being quite keen on Redux already, I find MobX's
  approach to the same problem... intriguing. It indeed seems simpler, at least
  to start working with, than complicated data flow in Redux, with all it's
  actions and reducers. It seems more human-readable. Hard to say if it's better
  or not and in which cases, but after my first experience, I want to try it
  more, to see its flaws and boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  When I first learned about MobX and read about it's simplicity, I thought that
  it must be also much more limited. Surprisingly, it seems to be very flexible
  and ready for variety of use cases, with plenty of different ways to interact
  with the state. I didn't discover them all, I touched only these, which I
  needed, but during my research I've realized, that it can do much more than
  simple use case I presented in this post. I'm wondering now how would it
  handle sophisticated, complex logic of real world applications, with hundreds
  of views, scenarios, API calls, etc. Redux might be an overkill for small
  project with one variable in state, but it handles these complex ones very
  well. How would MobX perform there? I guess I'll see it in future.
</p>
<p>
  One last thought I had on this subject: introduction of global state to your
  application makes you rethink data flow within it. I was horrified by some of
  ideas I had when I implemented this blog originally, almost 2 years ago, when
  I was forced to look at them closely, while adapting different components for
  integration with MobX. I had to do some refactoring, because I realized, some
  of those little monsters I had here and there cannot exist peacefully in
  organized world, which I created with MobX. When it comes to this point, I
  think it's the same with Redux. Having one of them in your application is not
  always the way to go, but once you introduce it, you might want to rethink
  your data flow and relations between components, and it's for the better.
