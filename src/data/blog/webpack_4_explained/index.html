<p>
  Here's what happens when you type <code>npm run build:base</code> and hit
  enter on cloned
  <a
    href="https://github.com/soofka/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate"
    target="_blank"
    >react-redux-typescript-boilerplate</a
  >
  repository. It invokes
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> (with
  <code>--color</code> parameter, because I like colors), a module bundler,
  which will build our application and output results in dist directory in
  project root. By "build" I mean transpilation of TypeScript code to ECMAScript
  6 (officially known as ECMAScript 2015), then transpilation from ES6 to
  browser-compatible JavaScript code with Babel (they actually use word
  "compiler" in their
  <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">documentation</a> now), then
  copying static assets, and a few other steps here and there. Webpack finds
  it's configuration in it's standard, expected location, which is root
  directory of our project, in a file named <code>webpack.config.js</code>.
  Actual configuration, however, is located in
  <code>/scripts/bundler</code> directory (this is because it's also used in
  other parts of the project).
</p>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
const getBundlerConfig = (environment = 'dev', mode = 'normal') => {
  const devEnv = environment === 'dev';

  console.log(`Bundling ${environment} package (mode: ${mode}`);

  return {
    entry: getEntry(),
    output: getOutput(),
    resolve: getResolve(),
    module: getModule(devEnv),
    plugins: getPlugins(devEnv, mode),
    mode: getMode(devEnv),
  }
};
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Main function of this script generates Webpack configuration. It will be
  different, depending on environment, and if it's meant for local server, or if
  it's meant for audit, which is represented by mode parameter.
</p>
<p>
  The configuration is verbose and not much self-explanatory to say the least.
  That's the main issue people have with Webpack, from what I hear, and it's
  also the main reason why this kind of explanation makes sense. And it's
  already on Webpack 4, believe me, it's been worse.
</p>
<h3>Entry</h3>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
const getEntry = () => {
  const main = [
    './src/index.tsx'
  ];

  const vendor =  [
    'axios',
    'babel-polyfill',
    'history',
    'immutable',
    'react',
    'react-dom',
    'react-redux',
    'react-router-dom',
    'react-router-redux',
    'redux',
    'redux-immutable',
    'redux-saga',
  ];

  return {
    main,
    vendor,
  };
};
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  First item in the configuration, <code>entry</code>, defines entry point for
  your JS files - where Webpack should start building it's dependency graphs. It
  is divided into two fields. main represents entry point to package with
  application source code - starting point of your application. From there,
  Webpack will basically analyze all imports and include them into this file. As
  a result, this file will often be a subject for change. <code>vendor</code>,
  on the other hand, represents all external dependencies, which will be
  naturally modified much more rarely and thus can be cached for increased
  performance. Content of this section is more less equal to
  <code>dependencies</code> section of <code>package.json</code> file.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
const getOutput = () => {
  return {
    path: path.resolve('dist'),
    publicPath: '/',
    filename: 'assets/js/[name].[hash].js',
  };
};
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Second item, <code>output</code>, tells Webpack where to emit the bundles it
  created, and how to name them. Therefore, field path pointing to
  <code>/dist</code> directory. Field <code>publicPath</code> defines a path
  where all assets that are not imported directly in your code, but linked, will
  be pointed to. Then, there are names and locations of files that will be
  produced as a result of this build. Using <code>[name]</code> means, that
  there will be main and vendor files produces, as defined in
  <code>entry</code>. Additionally, using <code>[hash]</code>, will add a unique
  string to the file name, which can help with cache busting for both
  development and production purposes.
</p>
<h3>Resolve</h3>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
const getResolve = () => ({
  modules: [
    'src',
    'node_modules'
  ],
  extensions: [
    '.ts',
    '.tsx',
    '.js'
  ]
});
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  This section defines how modules are resolved. Quoting Webpack documentation,
  "webpack provides reasonable defaults", and it appears to be true, so we only
  want to tell it where should he look for our modules and how do they look
  like.
</p>
<h3>Module</h3>
<partial name="code" language="javascript">
  <pre>
const getModule = (devEnv) => {
  let typeScriptLoaders = [];

  if (!devEnv) {
    typeScriptLoaders.push('babel-loader');
  }

  typeScriptLoaders.push(
    {
      loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader',
      query: {
        configFileName: 'tsconfig.json',
        silent: true
      }
    },
    {
      loader: 'tslint-loader',
      query: {
        configFile: 'tslintconfig.json'
      },
    }
  );

  const styleLoaders = ExtractTextWebpackPlugin.extract({
    use: [
      {
        loader: 'css-loader',
        options: {
          minimize: !devEnv,
        }
      },
      {
        loader: 'sass-loader',

      name: 'assets/fonts/[name].[ext]?[hash]',
    },
  }];

  const imageLoaders = [{
    loader: 'file-loader',
    options: {
      name: 'assets/images/[name].[ext]?[hash]',
    },
  }];

  if (!devEnv) {
    imageLoaders.push('image-webpack-loader');
  }

  return {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loaders: typeScriptLoaders,
      },
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,

      {
        test: /\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff|woff2)$/,
        loader: fontLoaders,
      }, {
        test: /\.(gif|ico|jpe?g|png|svg)$/,
        loaders: imageLoaders,
      },
    ],
  };
};

</partial>
<p>
  <code>module</code> section is where some fun starts, with creative ways to
  utilize Webpack. This section defines how different types of modules will be
  treated by Webpack. Different kinds of assets can be imported in your code,
  and will automatically added to the resulting bundle, if handled properly in
  this section. Each kind of asset may be treated differently - copied, bundled,
  modified - with different loader, based on regular expression matching the
  file name.
</p>
<p>
  Loaders for each type of asset are invoked in a sequence, starting from the
  last one in the array. That's why for files with TypeScript code there will be
  <a href="https://github.com/wbuchwalter/tslint-loader" target="_blank"
    >TSLint Loader</a
  >
  invoked first, which will present it's output in the console (as defined in
  <code>tslintconfig.json</code>). Then,
  <a
    href="https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader"
    target="_blank"
    >Awesome Typescript Loader</a
  >
  will transpile TypeScript code to ES6 (as defined in
  <code>tsconfig.json</code>), and then Babel (in case of code meant for
  production environment) will transpile it further to JavaScript understood by
  common browsers (as defined in <code>.babelrc</code>).
</p>
<p>
  For styles, they will be first transpiled from SCSS to CSS with
  <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader" target="_blank"
    >SASS Loader</a
  >, and then bundled with
  <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader" target="_blank"
    >CSS Loader</a
  >. Moreover,
  <a
    href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin"
    target="_blank"
    >Extract Text Webpack Plugin</a
  >
  will move all CSS modules to separate file, as defined in plugins section of
  this configuration. For other kinds of modules that can be imported in your TS
  code, they will be treated with
  <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader" target="_blank"
    >File Loader</a
  >
  (or
  <a href="https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader" target="_blank"
    >Image Webpack Loader</a
  >, in case of need for production-level image optimization). All of them will
  then be put in <code>/dist/assets</code> directory.

  In <code>plugins</code> section one can do some really nasty magic with
  Webpack. There is quite big
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/" target="_blank"
    >library of Webpack built-in plugins</a
  >
  available, and there are much more provided by there community out there. One
  can always
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/contribute/writing-a-plugin/" target="_blank"
    >write his own too</a
  >, using
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/api/plugins/" target="_blank"
    >Webpack Plugins API</a
  >. In this example, I'm using Webpack plugins to
  <a
    href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin"
    target="_blank"
    >copy static assets to dist directory</a
  >,
  <a href="https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin" target="_blank"
    >generate index.html file according to my configuration and automatically
    include all styles and scripts in it</a

<p>
  The last bit of Webpack configuration is perhaps the most mysterious. Setting
  this option properly tells Webpack to use its built-in optimizations
  accordingly, which includes minification and uglification of bundle for
  production environment.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, as a result of main function of Webpack bundling script, there is a
  Webpack configuration produced for given build, based on it's environment and
  mode. Then, the config is applied by Webpack, which bundles the application in
  certain way, plus performs all those extra tasks like transpilation,
  compression, copying files in a meantime. Then, operation outcome is printed
  in console, while resulting bundle lands in dist directory.
</p>
<p>
  I hope that one, having this detailed description of the whole process, will
  have an easier time modifying it in order to adjust it to his needs.
