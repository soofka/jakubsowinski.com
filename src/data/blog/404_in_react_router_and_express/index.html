  My goal was to have Not Found page as part of my Single Page Application, not
  some separate and entirely different piece of code, which I can't reliably
  control, and which may stand out noticeably from my sleek user interface. It
  required me to shift most of the decision making process when it comes to
  routing from my back-end to my front-end. Therefore, I came to realization,
  that I will now use
  <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> to serve static
  content only, and this is
  <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html" target="_blank"
    >common and well documented use case</a
  >. Quickly I came up with simple configuration, that always serves static
  <code>index.html</code> file.

  <pre>
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../dist/index.html')));

app.use((request, response) => {
  fs.readFile(indexPath, (error, file) => {
    if (error) {
      response.status(404).send(error.toString());
    } else {
      response.status(200).send(file.toString());
    }
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
</pre

  Then, I moved to
  <a href="https://reactrouter.com/" target="_blank">React-Router</a>. Basic
  component of this library is <code>Route</code>, with property
  <code>path</code>, which describes chunk of URL, corresponding to the view to
  be displayed. React-Router documentation states, that "routes without a path
  always match", and that was exactly what I needed. Having
  <code>Route</code> without path, pointing to Not Found view, I only needed to
  redirect some other routes to meaningful views that I had consciously created,
  and everything else is covered.
</p>
<p>
  However, in React-Router, routes on their own render when they match URL
  inclusively. Not Found view stated as a <code>Route</code> without path would
  render unconditionally and irrespectively of the URL. <code>Switch</code>,
  also coming from React-Router, solved me this issue. In <code>Switch</code>,
  routes render when they match the URL exclusively, which means that always up
  to one <code>Route</code> will be rendered, and always it will be the first
  one that matches the URL. I put my Not Found <code>Route</code> at the end of
  <code>Switch</code>, and I was good to leave the office. Job well done.
